Node roads is a mod by MatyasP that adds one-node roads.
Now, mod has 8 slope nodes, 255 (85 per top texture, types node, slab, flat) road & crossroads nodes, 1 sidewalk node (too 1 flat and 1 slab), 6 bridge nodes & 6 bridge slabs, 2 bridge pillar nodes.

Crafting for survival is planned for future, but now isn't any crafting.

Knowed issues: repainting doing only different work that is needed.

AI used for basic help of syntax LUA code (contain too some bugfixes). OBJs are hand-written, textures made by human in basic painting software (Paint.net).
